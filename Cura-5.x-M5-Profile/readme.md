## Known Issues

- Printed speed will report and warn higher than 5x because of how Cura calculates speed. There are no significant quality or other impacts on the actual print.

## Overview

These profiles will allow you to add the AnkerMake M5 as a new printer in the menus.
Installing the profile:

1. Open Cura
1. Under the Help Menu, choose "Show Configuration Folder" (keep this folder open for the next several steps).
1. Close out of Cura
1. Download [Cura-5.x-M5-Profile.zip](https://github.com/just-trey/AnkerMake-M5-Profile/releases/latest/download/Cura-5.x-M5-Profile.zip)
1. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice and open the folder.
1. Copy the Contents of this folder to the Configuration folder you opened in step two. (Note you will be adding files to the directories)
1. Open Cura, and you should not be able to add a new AnkerMake M5 Printer.
