## Overview

This repository contains the latest versions of the AnkerMake M5 configurations for both Cura and PrusaSlicer. These profiles have officially been submitted to Cura and PrusaSlicer projects, and the configurations will be available to install directly within Cura and PrusaSlicer in their upcoming versions.

We will actively maintain this repository to store the configurations for both products, allowing for iterative improvement and testing of the profiles.
